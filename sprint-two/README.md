DESIGN : followed requested design implementations as closely as possible while making components responsive between breakpoints. Created custom buttons for media player, but haven't implemented functionality yet, but it's responsive between requested breakpoints.

RESPONSIVENESS : implemented throught all breakpoints, but I'm especially happy with responsiveness between 320px and 768px, as it's usually the hardest one. From 768 to 1440 every component is centered and hero video stretches until it reaches the width and heigh of provided design specifications at 1440px. Other elemetns(except for the navigation bar) don't stretch because inceresing the width of comment card and video description width will go against best design practices. Side video section is also scalable and text adjusts depending on the width of the container, so the text ellipsis work correctly. Also as a bonus I made this section scrolabble.

FUNCTIONALITY : used state as requested. Even though it's hardcoded, I coded with API in mind, so it should be a quick change when we will get real data available. As for side videos I implemented them in the same way as the main video - used real image urls, etc. to make sure it's going to work properly when real data will be used. Also both main video and comments use dynamic timestamp function. New comment functionality was implemented as well, because why not! Comments counter is also functional and will
