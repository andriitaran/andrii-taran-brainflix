DESIGN : Upload page is created following design guidelines and is fully responsive.

FUNCTIONALITY : All requested functionality added. As a bonus I decided not to hardcode main video but make it dynamic, which led to quite a few challenges, but it was a great learning opurtunity! 

DIVING DEEPER : Both posting comments and deleting comments features are implemented! I also tried to add "like" button and click event for it, but it looks like API doesn't have a working PUT method. Also, I could not comment inside return sections of components, so I'm just writing here that comment count dynamically updates as the new comments are added. Started working on implementing refs into video player and already did a play/payse button. Included more comments inside my code as requested!
